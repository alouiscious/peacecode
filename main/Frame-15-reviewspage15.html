PENDER HARBOUR BLUES FEST<br />
<br />
They're hot, they're new (their first show was in 2004), and<br />
they've already been nominated for Best Band by the prestigious<br />
Washington Blues Society's Best of the Blues Awards.<br />
They are the Red Hot Blues Sisters, the headline act at this<br />
year's Pender Harbour Blues Festival. The professional musicians<br />
from Seattle have never performed in Canada before, but just two<br />
years ago they sat in at the Yale Hotel in Vancouver with the<br />
Cal Batchelor band (see below) a connection that now leads them<br />
back to B.C. to perform on May 12 and 13. Guitarist Teri Anne<br />
Wilson and vocalist Suze Sims front the group and are the<br />
songwriters for the work of Chris Leighton on drums, Lissa<br />
Romaglia and Scotty Harris.<br />
Fans love them.<br />
Our recent success and recognition is a blessing that we are very<br />
grateful for,&quot; says lead singer Sims.<br />
Find the Red Hot Blues Sisters at the Madeira Park Legion on<br />
Friday and Saturday nights with tickets for $20 or $25 at the<br />
door. Tickets are available at the Paper Mill or the Legion in<br />
Madeira Park, Talewind Books and Coast Books.<br />
More about the Blues Festival can be found at www.phblues.com or<br />

<div align="left">Seattle&rsquo;s Red Hot Blues Sisters display their proficiency at different blues styles on their new five-song EP, &ldquo;Hot Off The Press.&rdquo; <br />
&ldquo;Flood In The Basement Blues&rdquo; is a country blues tune with a healthy helping of twang. <br />
<br />
Lead singer Suze Sims bemoans the condition of her home after a flood and dealing with the landlord. &ldquo;Everything floats in a basement, only the good stuff sunk/It only rained 20 minutes, but that was the first day, son.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Pour Your Heart Out&rdquo; is a warning to someone being manipulated by greedy and power hungry people. &ldquo;Folks on a witch hunt they burned you at the stake/take it from me it&rsquo;s your lucky break.&rdquo; Saxophone adds an interesting element to the music.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Transactions&rdquo; is a sophisticated, Chicago-style blues number, with a smooth saxophone line. Sims warns against materialism. &ldquo;Wishful luck of mass consumers, driven by sadistic rumors.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Ocean Beaches&rdquo; has soulful vocals and guitars. Sims professes a love of the beach to make an allegory about success and failure in life. &ldquo;Ocean Beaches my next stop/waves to me on the rocks/ocean beaches my best friends/until the end.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;See You&rdquo; could be a tribute to a friend who has passed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve turned my face to the sun because I know I&rsquo;m not the only one/the flowers in your garden smell so fine,&rdquo; Sims sings. This song really allows her to display her vocal range.<br />
<br />
Red Hot Blues Sisters play Fort Lewis at 2 p.m. July 4 and Celebration Park in Federal Way at 7 p.m. July 4. They play University Place Festival at 6 p.m. Aug. 5.<br />
